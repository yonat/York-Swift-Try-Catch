### What is it? ###
A simple wrapper for Objective-C and C++ NSExceptions that can be thrown by some Objective-C based APIs. As NSExceptions cannot be captured by Swift (Swift only captures NSError ones), this wrapper was created to allow Exception handling in swift.

## Requirements
* iOS 8.0+ or OS X 10.9+

## Installation

York-Swift-Try-Catch is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "York-Swift-Try-Catch"
```


## Simple Example
```objc
// import the header
import York_Swift_Try_Catch

// Wrap any code that can throw a NSException
TryCatchFinally.handleTryBlock({ () -> Void in
  try! self.fetchedResultsController.performFetch()
  self.tableView.reloadData()
}) { (exception: NSException!) -> Void in
  let error = NSError(domain: "", code: 9999, userInfo: exception.userInfo)
  self.logger.logError(error)
}
```
